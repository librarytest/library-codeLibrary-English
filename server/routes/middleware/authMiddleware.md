  # authMiddleware.mjs
  ## Code Explanation

This code snippet defines a function called `ensureAuthenticated` that is typically used in web applications to ensure that a user is authenticated before allowing access to certain routes or resources.

- `req`: Represents the request object in a web application. It contains information about the HTTP request made by the client.
- `res`: Represents the response object in a web application. It is used to send a response back to the client.
- `next`: Represents the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.

### Functionality
1. The `ensureAuthenticated` function checks if the user is authenticated by calling `req.isAuthenticated()`. This method is commonly used in web frameworks like Express.js with Passport.js for user authentication.
2. If the user is authenticated (`req.isAuthenticated()` returns `true`), the function calls `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function in the stack.
3. If the user is not authenticated, the function redirects the user to the root URL (`'/'`) using `res.redirect('/')`. This is a common practice to redirect unauthenticated users to a login page.

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Import the ensureAuthenticated function
import { ensureAuthenticated } from './authMiddleware';

// Route that requires authentication
app.get('/profile', ensureAuthenticated, (req, res) => {
    res.render('profile');
});
```

In this example, the `ensureAuthenticated` function is used as middleware for the `/profile` route. If the user is authenticated, the `profile` page is rendered; otherwise, the user is redirected to the root URL.
  
  ## Component Code
  ```jsx
  export const ensureAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
    if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
        return next();
    } else {
        res.redirect('/');
    }
};
  ```
