  # aiRoutes.mjs
  # Code Explanation

This code snippet is a part of a Node.js application using Express framework. It defines two POST routes `/test-prompt` and `/transform-code` for handling file processing and code transformation requests, respectively.

### Dependencies
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Multer**: A middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files.
- **helpers/aiHelper.mjs**: Contains functions `createFile` and `transformCode` for processing files and transforming code.
- **middleware/authMiddleware.mjs**: Contains the `ensureAuthenticated` middleware function for ensuring user authentication.

### Code Explanation
1. **Router Setup**: 
   - The code sets up an Express router to handle different routes.
   - It imports necessary dependencies like `express`, `multer`, and custom helper functions.

2. **File Processing Route `/test-prompt`**:
   - This route expects a POST request with a file attached and some additional data like `model` and `instructions`.
   - It first checks if a file is uploaded, then reads the file content as a UTF-8 string.
   - The `createFile` function is called with the file content, model, and instructions to process the file.
   - The processed text is sent back as a response along with the original file name.

3. **Code Transformation Route `/transform-code`**:
   - This route expects a POST request with code content and transformation instructions.
   - It calls the `transformCode` function with the code content and transformation instructions.
   - The transformed code text is sent back as a response.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Both routes have error handling to catch and log any exceptions that occur during file processing or code transformation.

### Example Usage
To use the `/test-prompt` route, you can send a POST request with a file attached and additional data like model and instructions. Here is an example using `curl`:
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@/path/to/file.txt" -F "model=model1" -F "instructions=instruction1" http://localhost:3000/test-prompt
```

To use the `/transform-code` route, you can send a POST request with code content and transformation instructions. Here is an example using `fetch` in JavaScript:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/transform-code', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ content: 'console.log("Hello, World!")', transformInstructions: 'transform1' }),
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to handle file processing and code transformation requests in a Node.js application using Express and Multer.
  
  ## Component Code
  ```jsx
  import express from "express";
import multer from "multer";
import { createFile, transformCode } from "./helpers/aiHelper.mjs";
import { ensureAuthenticated } from "./middleware/authMiddleware.mjs";

const router = express.Router();
const upload = multer();

router.post(
  "/test-prompt",
  ensureAuthenticated,
  upload.single("file"),
  async (req, res) => {
    const { model, instructions } = req.body;

    if (!req.file) {
      return res.status(400).send("No file uploaded.");
    }

    const file = req.file;
    const content = file.buffer.toString("utf8");

    try {
    

      const completion = await createFile(content, model, instructions);
      const explanation = completion.text;
      console.log(completion.text);
      res.json({
        message: "File processed successfully!",
        data: {
          fileName: file.originalname,
          prompt: explanation,
        },
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to process file:", error);
      res.status(500).send("Failed to process file");
    }
  }
);


router.post('/transform-code', ensureAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  const { content, transformInstructions } = req.body;

  try {
      const result = await transformCode(content, transformInstructions);
      console.log(result.text)
      res.json(result.text);
  } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to transform code:', error);
      res.status(500).send('Failed to transform code');
  }
});


export default router;
  ```
