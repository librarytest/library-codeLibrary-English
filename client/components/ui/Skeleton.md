  # Skeleton.jsx
  ## Explanation of the Code

The provided code is a React functional component named `Skeleton`. This component returns a JSX element representing a skeleton loading screen.

### Code Breakdown
- `const Skeleton =()=> { ... }`: This line defines a functional component named `Skeleton`.
- `return ( ... )`: The `return` statement inside the component contains the JSX code that will be rendered when the `Skeleton` component is used.
- `<div className="skeleton h-screen w-screen"></div>`: This line creates a `div` element with the classes `skeleton`, `h-screen` (full height), and `w-screen` (full width). These classes are typically used for styling purposes to create a full-screen loading skeleton effect.

### Usage
To use this `Skeleton` component in a React application, you can import it and include it in other components where you want to display a loading skeleton.

Example Usage:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Skeleton from './Skeleton'; // Assuming the file containing the Skeleton component is in the same directory

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>
      <Skeleton /> {/* Display the loading skeleton */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
